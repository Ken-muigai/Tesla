            <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">ELECTRIC CARS</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more
                 electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: -70px;">The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric
                 cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, 
                 until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in 
                 particular, and mass production of cheaper petrol (gasoline) and 
                 diesel vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles.</p>
            <p>However, as technology advances, automobile companies have found 
                efficient ways of producing cars capable of charging at reasonable 
                hours and the car can last upto a day of driving.</p>

        <h3>CHARGING, ELECTRICAL USAGE AND INSTALLATION</h3>

        <p>Yes - they are more expensive to purchase. Electric cars cost more than 
            conventional, combustion engine vehicles (not for long though), yet the 
            costs of charging are much lower than of fueling with gasoline. Here's a 
            short introduction for estimating how much electricity does your EV need,
             and how will it affect your wallet. The energy consumption of an EV depends
              on the vehicle, driving habits and the weather (just like with any other
               vehicle). A large family station wagon consumes much more electricity
                than a tiny EV, and commuting at the city center is much more efficient
                 compared to driving at the highway with full speed. Most electric
                  vehicles can cover up to 100 kilometres with 15 kWh. Their low energy
                   loss makes means that they are not very energy intensive. While
                    petrol or diesel engines convert a maximum of 35 % of this energy 
                    into driving force, an electric car reaches 90 % and more</p>

            <p>Changing seasons also have a high impact on the consumption, as the
                 electricity consumption rises a lot on cold climate. Heating and 
                 cooling decrease the charge of a battery. 
                setting up a home charging outlet costs around $1,750 for the charging 
                circuit wiring, and the charging outlet cost can vary from:
                
                Less than $100 for a standard electrical power point
                Up to $500 for a basic dedicated EV charging unit
                Up to $2,500 for a more advanced dedicated EV charging unit.
                The cost of the charging circuit wiring also varies greatly 
                according to the needs of the household. A licensed electrical 
                contractor (try Master Electricians) can offer advice on this.</p>

        <h3>The Biggest Pros and Cons of Electric Vehicles</h3>

            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have made huge technological strides since
                 they were first introduced, and they’re more popular than ever before.
                  Yet some drivers are still hesitant to make the switch from traditional
                   gas-powered cars, in large part due to misconceptions that EVs still 
                   suffer the same shortcomings they did in their earlier years. While
                    electric cars do, indeed, have their downsides, there are also 
                    considerable benefits to owning one. The benefits of owning an EV 
                    arguably outweigh any cons — from spending less money in the long run 
                    to making fewer trips to the repair shop. And it doesn’t stop there.</p>
